 ## Background
 <p>The COVID19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2). The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020 and a pandemic on 11th March. The first case of the virus was confirmed in Sri Lanka on 27th January 2020, after a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei Province in China was admitted to the National Institute of Infection Diseases.</p>

<p>As of 16 August 2020, 2,890 confirmed cases have been reported in the country with 11 deaths. On 3rd March 2020, the first reported case involving a Sri Lankan origin outside Sri Lanka was reported in Italy. As of 23 March, forty-five quarantine centers have been built in the country by the Sri Lanka Army as a preventive measure to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 3,500 people have been under quarantine in 45 quarantine centers which also include 31 foreigners from 14 countries.</p>

<p>As of 25 March 2020, Sri Lankan authorities have tracked down over 14,000 people who had contacted the identified patients and had ordered self-quarantine for such people.</p>  
## Problem
<p>When putting a person under self-quarantine, medical officers and the police will come to the house where that person lives and advise that person not to go out. Even though the person under self-quarantine is advised not to go out the medical officers cannot be guaranteed that the person will not go out because they do not have a proper method to monitor the people under self-quarantine. If people under self-quarantine do not obey the rules and go out of the home and interact with other people, there will be a risk of exposing other people to the virus if those self-quarantined people are infected.  And also there is no any method to know if the body temperature of a self-quarantined person has increased.</p>

## Solution
<p>Implementation of a wearable device that can be used to track the location and measure the body temperature of the person under self-quarantine. This device will be having features such as,</p>
<ul>
  <li>GPS precise positioning</li>
  <li>Can set a virtual fence</li>
  <li>Detect and monitor the body temperature</li>
  <li>Unauthorized removal notifications</li>
  <li>Low battery notification</li>
  <li>Designed as a wrist band</li>
</ul>
