 ## Background
 <p>The COVID19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2). The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

The first case of the virus was confirmed in Sri Lanka on 27th January 2020, after a 44-year-old Chinese woman from Hubei Province in China was admitted to the National Institute of Infection Diseases.</p>
 
  We are going to track the people who are under quarantine due to be associated with a COVID19 patient and haven't proved that he/she hasn't yet 
  a COVID19 patient, but there is the possibility to be so. 
  Usually there movements are limited into their house and advised to be in for 14 days of time period. Using the quarantine tracker, we are tracking
  their movements (check if they violates the rules) as well as the device can measure parameters such as body temperature.
  The device will be used by the medical authority and they regularly check on this parameters. 
  The main reason to introduce this device is to facilitate the medical party's duty and to make sure that the society is out of danger of exposing to the virus.
